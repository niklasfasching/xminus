* keyed for
until now only unkeyed for loop (i.e. disregards state and can re-use elements independent of identity)
keyed will allow keeping local state in looped components
* app component
add localstorage proxy as app.db
* register macros / directives
script tag with [x-compile] or [x-macros] that is executed at bundle / compile time and can register macros
we can guard macro definitions to bundle time by setting a var in bundle and throwing e.g. if !window.bundleTime
as macros would be global and regexes rather than exact match it's hard to ensure macros do not conflict
* improve headless
- directory listing with globbing
- disable cache (headers/--disk-cache-size): sometimes cli needs to be restarted for changes to become visible. i guess that's due to caching
* assumptions
- everythting in create can close over provided variables. we must not just provide a variable with the same name in update, we must modify the original variable
